SDE II @ AWS

I work on developer tools, lately related to automated code changes being made at scale across Amazon.
Previously, I worked on the JS/TS ecosystem and associated build systems.

My most recent experience is in Golang building backend software deployed as a static binary,
but I have also written backend projects in Typescript and Python, and worked with React for frontend stuff.

On my profile you will mostly see small projects from my university days,
though I do expect to be contributing more personal projects soon.
